# Cryptocurrencies
Module 19 Challenge, Unsupervised Machine Learning - UNCCH Data Analytics Bootcamp, Spring 2023

## Project Overview

### Purpose
    In this exercise, I assisted Martha, a senior manager for Advisory Services Team at Accountability Accounting, with applying unsupervised machine learning to a dataset to help to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for her company's potential investment. 

## Method
Python libraries from "scikit-learn" including "StandardScaler", "MinMaxScaler", "PCA", and "KMeans" were used to perform the analysis. The data needed to be processed to fit the machine learning models. It was decided to use a clustering algorithm to group the cryptocurrencies, and hvplot visualizations to share findings with the board of the company.

From the Module 19 Challenge:
```
    Part 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
    Part 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
    Part 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
    Part 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
```
